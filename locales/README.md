# Localizations

This tree holds translated copies of selected SKILL.md files for human
review and downstream LLM use in non-English contexts.

Translations are **informational** — they are not auto-loaded by the
CLI. The canonical English file under `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` remains the
source of truth for the validator, evidence reports, and IDE config
generators.

Initial coverage (Phase 5):

| Locale | Skills |
|---|---|
| `es` (Spanish) | secret-detection, supply-chain-security, infrastructure-security |
| `fr` (French)  | secret-detection, supply-chain-security, infrastructure-security |
| `de` (German)  | secret-detection, supply-chain-security, infrastructure-security |

Each translated SKILL.md keeps the same YAML frontmatter shape as the
English original, with the addition of a top-level `language: <bcp47>`
field.

To add a new locale or skill, copy the English SKILL.md into
`locales/<locale>/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`, translate the prose, set the
`language` field, and update this table.
