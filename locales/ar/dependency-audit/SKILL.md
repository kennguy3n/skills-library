# Dependency Audit

## Rules (for AI agents)

### ALWAYS
- Pin dependencies to exact versions in lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`,
  `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`).
- Cross-check every new dependency name against the bundled malicious-package list in
  `vulnerabilities/supply-chain/malicious-packages/`.
- Prefer well-established packages with high download counts, multiple maintainers, and
  recent activity over newer alternatives that solve the same problem.
- Run the package manager's audit command (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`,
  `govulncheck`) and review reported issues before merging.
- Verify the package's repository URL on the package page actually exists and matches
  the linked GitHub / GitLab / Codeberg project.

### NEVER
- Add a dependency without pinning its version.
- Install packages with `--unsafe-perm` or equivalent flags that bypass install
  sandboxing.
- Add a dependency whose name appears in the bundled malicious-package list.
- Add a brand-new package (published within the last 30 days) without a clear,
  documented reason — typosquats are usually freshly published.
- Use the `latest` tag in a production lockfile or container image FROM line.
- Commit unused dependencies — they expand the attack surface for free.

### KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES
- Internal monorepo packages (`@yourco/*`) flagged as "unknown" — these are valid when
  the namespace is owned by your organization.
- New patch versions of stable packages (e.g. `react@18.2.5` after `18.2.4`) flagged as
  "recently published" — patch updates are usually fine.
- Package names that legitimately overlap with malicious entries from years ago that
  have been re-registered by the original maintainer.

## Context (for humans)

Supply chain attacks have grown faster than any other attack category since 2019.
Compromise of a popular package (event-stream, ua-parser-js, colors, faker, xz-utils)
or publication of a typosquat (axois vs axios, urllib3 vs urlib3) reliably nets the
attacker thousands of downstream victims within hours.

AI coding tools are particularly vulnerable because the model has no visibility into
when a package was last compromised. The model recommends what it learned during
training; if a maintainer was compromised after the training cutoff, the AI happily
recommends a backdoored version.

This skill compensates by injecting the live malicious-package database into the AI's
working context and requiring the AI to consult it before adding any dependency.
