# Infrastructure Security

## Rules (for AI agents)

### ALWAYS
- Pin base images by digest (`FROM image@sha256:...`) when building containers for
  production. Tags are mutable; digests are not.
- Run containers as a non-root `USER` other than `0`. Add `securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true` to K8s pod specs.
- Set explicit Kubernetes resource requests AND limits (`requests.cpu`,
  `requests.memory`, `limits.cpu`, `limits.memory`).
- Drop all Linux capabilities and re-add only what's required
  (`securityContext.capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`).
- Mark filesystems read-only (`securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`) when the
  workload doesn't legitimately need write access.
- Enable encryption at rest (`enable_kms_encryption`, `kms_key_id`,
  `server_side_encryption_configuration`) for S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS, DynamoDB.
- Set `block_public_access` on every S3 bucket unless the workload genuinely serves
  public content.
- Apply the principle of least privilege to IAM policies: name explicit actions and
  resources; avoid `*:*` and `Resource: "*"` outside of intentional admin policies.

### NEVER
- Use `latest` as the image tag in production manifests.
- Run a container with `--privileged` flag or `securityContext.privileged: true`.
- Mount the host `/var/run/docker.sock` into a container.
- Expose Kubernetes services with `type: LoadBalancer` on the open internet without an
  ingress controller, WAF, or authentication layer in front.
- Hardcode AWS keys / GCP service-account keys / Azure client secrets in IaC. Use
  IRSA, GKE Workload Identity, Azure managed identities, or the platform-native
  equivalent.
- Create S3 buckets with `acl = "public-read"` for buckets containing anything other
  than intentionally public assets.
- Allow `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on database, SSH, RDP, or admin ports.
- Disable `node_to_node_encryption` on Elasticsearch / OpenSearch.

### KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES
- Pinning image digests is not always practical in dev / preview environments — tag
  pinning (e.g. `node:20.11.1-alpine`) is acceptable there.
- `Resource: "*"` is acceptable in policies that are documented admin-only with
  explicit `Condition` constraints.
- `runAsNonRoot: false` is acceptable when the workload genuinely requires root (e.g.,
  binding to port 80, certain network tooling). Document why.

## Context (for humans)

Misconfigured infrastructure is the dominant cause of cloud breaches. The patterns
above codify the most-violated CIS benchmark items into rules the AI applies during
generation, not after deployment.
